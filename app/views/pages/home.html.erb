		<h3>
			Intro
		</h3>
		<p>
			Git Reports is a free service that lets you set up a stable URL for anonymous users to submit bugs and other Issues to your GitHub repositories, without exposing your code, requiring users to log in with GitHub, or using a messy <%= link_to "two-repository solution", "https://help.github.com/articles/issues-only-access-permissions" %>.  It works with public and private repositories, and it works with personal and organization repositories.  It's super easy to set up: <%= link_to "log in", login_path%>, allow access, and activate your repository from the list!  Check out the <%= link_to "tutorial", tutorial_path %> for more details.

		<h3>
			Pricing
		</h3>
		<p>
			Free and ad-free!  This service is the side project of a broke college student, so if you like it, throw me a few dollars.

			Author
		</h3>
		<p>
			Made with love by <%= link_to "Zach Schneider", "http://www.schneidmaster.com" %>.  I'll be graduating in May with my CS degree, so if your company needs Rails developers, check out my <%= link_to "r&eacute;sum&eacute;".html_safe, "http://schneidmaster.com/docs/Zachariah_Schneider_Resume.pdf" %>.

		<h3>
			What's with the permissions?
		</h3>
		<p>
			The GitHub API doesn't have a whole lot of <%= link_to "scope options", "http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes" %>; unfortunately, in order to get write access to a repo's issues, I also have to request write access to the full repo.  The site's open-source, though, so you can <%= link_to "check it out for yourself", "https://github.com/schneidmaster/gitreports.com" %> or even self-host your own copy if that's your thing.

		<h3>
			I found a bug/have a feature/etc.!
		</h3>
		<p>
			Dogfood it with a bug report <%= link_to "here", "http://gitreports.com/issue/schneidmaster/gitreports.com" %>, or you can just <%= link_to "create a new issue", "https://github.com/schneidmaster/gitreports.com/issues/new" %> on GitHub; the repo's public.  Feel free to send a pull request if you fix a bug or add a new feature.
